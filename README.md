# Motion-Planning-of-a-differential-drive-robot-
This project aims to combine the image processing with path planning techniques to extract an obstacle course using a camera and process the image to segment obstacles. Then, we test various path planning algorithms to get the shortest path. Once the path is generated, the path is smoothened using spline interpolation. Further, the differential drive motion planning equations are used to navigate the drive on the path and appropriate control algorithm is applied to mitigate the errors.

Objective of this project is not only to successfully track but to enhance tracking ability of the system by improving algorithms and control system. Efforts will be towards achieving tracking at higher framerate and at higher resolution then currently achieved by some people. During this project the obstacle detection part will be carried out using several Computer Vision algorithms and image processing techniques. The developed system has many applications in advance systems including defense, surveillance, monitoring, humanoid robots, etc. Also a method to evaluate performance of the system has to be developed. The scope of the present work involves the conceptual design and assembly of the tank drive robot, its wireless control and a python “Pygame” simulation of the robot navigating different paths on different obstacle courses.
