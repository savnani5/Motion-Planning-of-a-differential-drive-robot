# Motion-Planning-of-a-differnetial-drive-robot-
The differential drive has an ESP32 board for wireless connectivity with a dual channel motor driver to control the DC motors. Also, a Client-Server network is established between the server laptop and client ESP to transmit the coordinates to the robot. An overhead camera is used to visually survey the obstacle course and image processing is used to segment the obstacles and the robot from the captured images. Further, the obstacle course is used to make a "visibility graph" and finally "Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm" is used to search the shortest pah from the robot position to the goal position. Kinematic Equations of the differential drive are used to drive the robot on the path obtained. Finally, a pygame simulation of the robot movement is made to predict the behavior of the robot in real world and the robot is driven using this simulation.
